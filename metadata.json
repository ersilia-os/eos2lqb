    "Title": "Human oral bioavailability prediction",
    "Description": "Prediction of human oral bioavailability for small molecules. Given SMILES, the HobPre model predicts the Human oral bioavailability (HOB) value (two cutoffs of 20% and 50% for classification of molecules). The prediction is either high or low HOB.",
    "Mode": "Pretrained",
    "Task": ["Classification"],
    "Input": ["Compound"],
    "Input Shape": "Single",
    "Output": ["Probability"],
    "Output Type": ["Float"],
    "Output Shape": "List",
    "Interpretation": "This model takes smiles as input and outputs the Probability(high) of human-oral-bioavailability(HOB) for both the 20% cutoff and that of 50% cutoff.  The first value is the probability of HOB being high at 20% cutoff and the second value is the probability of HOB being high at 50% cutoff.",
