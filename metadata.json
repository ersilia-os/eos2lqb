    "Title": "Human oral bioavailability prediction",
    "Description": "HobPre predicts the oral bioavailability of small molecules in humans. It has been trained using public data on ~1200 molecules (Falc\u00f3n-Cano et al, 2020, complemented with other literature and ChEMBL compounds). The molecules were labeled according to two cut-offs: HOB > 20% and HOB > 50%, due to ongoing discussions as to which would be a more appropriate cut-off.",
